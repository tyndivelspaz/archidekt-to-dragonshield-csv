A Simple CSV converter for taking Archidekt deck lists and transforming them into a valid import into Dragonshield's Inventory as a new folder with the deck's name.

I made this converter to quickly get my decklists included in my inventory tracking within Dragonshield. I did not want to struggle with the Dragonshield scanner have difficulties identifying cards through the card sleeves. This is just a faster way to have all fo the cards incorporated for inventory tracking purposes. They can then be moved into another more appropriate folder if necessary and the decklists from archidekt can be imported into dragonshield's decklist section for extra redundancy. 

## TODO:
1. Clean up the overall UI as it was more about function than looks and ease of use.
